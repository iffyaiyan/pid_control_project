## 1. Project Overview

In this project you'll revisit the lake race track from the Behavioral Cloning Project. This time, however, you'll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

The simulator will provide you the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

One more thing. The speed limit has been increased from 30 mph to 100 mph. Get ready to channel your inner Vin Diesel and try to drive SAFELY as fast as possible! NOTE: you don't have to meet a minimum speed to pass.


## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

**Hints!**

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## The PID Components
In this project I am using proportional, integral and differential control

**Proportional or P Control:** The (P) component is the proportional gain constant and defines the period and magnituted of the step response, it steer the car proportional to the CTE and help us to minimize the error between CTE and the Steer Value is determined by the constant Kp.

**Integral or I Control:** The Integral (I) component of the controller produces an output response which is the summation of the current cte and previous values of cte(s) since the start to the current time step. The output response is adjusted by the integral gain constant, Ki. Therefore integral component tends to make the car go in circles because of accumulation of cte over time.

**Differential or D Control:** The Differentiale (D) component of the controller produces an output response which depends on the rate of change of cte.The output response is adjusted by the derivative gain constant, Kd. Therefore derivative component tends to counteract the overshoot of the car caused by the proportional component.

## Hyperparameters

The hyperparameters of Kp,Ki & Kd for the PID control of steering value and throttle were chosen manually by trial and error method and also with the understanding of how each parameter effects the control. 
A secondary PID controller is implemented to control the throttle. Inside this controler is included a Fuzzy controler to avoid overspeed or driving back behavior.
